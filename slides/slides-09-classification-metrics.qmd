## Announcements 

- Important information about midterm 1
  - https://piazza.com/class/m01ukubppof625/post/249
- HW4 has been released. Due next week Monday. 
- HW5 will be released next week Tuesday. It's a project-type assignment and you get till Oct 28th to work on it.

## ML workflow

## Confusion matrix questions 

Imagine a spam filter model where emails classified as spam are labeled 1 and non-spam emails are labeled 0. If a spam email is incorrectly classified as non-spam, what is this error called?

- (A) A false positive
- (B) A true positive
- (C) A false negative
- (D) A true negative

## Confusion matrix questions

In an intrusion detection system, intrusions are identified as 1 and non-intrusive activities as 0. If the system fails to identify an actual intrusion, wrongly categorizing it as non-intrusive, what is this type of error called?

- (A) A false positive
- (B) A true positive
- (C) A false negative
- (D) A true negative

## Confusion matrix questions

In a medical test for a disease, diseased states are labeled as 1 and healthy states as 0. If a healthy patient is incorrectly diagnosed with the disease, what is this error known as?

- (A) A false positive
- (B) A true positive
- (C) A false negative
- (D) A true negative


## iClicker Exercise 9.1

**iClicker cloud join link: https://join.iclicker.com/VYFJ**

**Select all of the following statements which are TRUE.**

- (A) In medical diagnosis, false positives are more damaging than false negatives (assume "positive" means the person has a disease, "negative" means they don't).
- (B) In spam classification, false positives are more damaging than false negatives (assume "positive" means the email is spam, "negative" means they it's not).
- (C) If method A gets a higher accuracy than method B, that means its precision is also higher.
- (D) If method A gets a higher accuracy than method B, that means its recall is also higher.

## Counter examples

Method A - higher accuracy but lower precision

| Negative | Positive
| -------- |:-------------:|
| 90      | 5|
| 5      | 0|

Method B - lower accuracy but higher precision

| Negative | Positive
| -------- |:-------------:|
| 80      | 15|
| 0      | 5|


## Thresholding Exercise 9.2

**iClicker cloud join link: https://join.iclicker.com/VYFJ**

**Select all of the following statements which are TRUE.**

- (A) If we increase the classification threshold, both true and false positives are likely to decrease.
- (B) If we increase the classification threshold, both true and false negatives are likely to decrease.
- (C) Lowering the classification threshold generally increases the modelâ€™s recall.  
- (D) Raising the classification threshold can improve the precision of the model if it effectively reduces the number of false positives without significantly affecting true positives.


## ROC AUC questions

Consider the points A, B, and C in the following diagram, each representing a threshold. Which threshold would you pick in each scenario?

:::: {.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}
![](img/auc_abc)
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

- (A) If false positives (false alarms) are highly costly
- (B) If false positives are cheap and false negatives (missed true positives) highly costly
- (C) If the costs are roughly equivalent
