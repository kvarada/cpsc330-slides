## iClicker Exercise 11.0

Which of the following scenarios has worked effectively for you in the past?

- (A) Working independently on a project/assignment.
- (B) Working with like-minded people.
- (C) Teaming up with a diverse group offering varied perspectives and skills.

## [The Wisdom of Crowds](http://wisdomofcrowds.blogspot.com/2009/12/introduction-part-i.html)

Groups can often make better decisions than individuals, especially when group members are diverse enough.

- Combine predictions from multiple models for a more accurate and stable result
- Classification: either take majority class or average predicted probabilities
- Regression: Average (mean or median) predictions
- Averaging reduces individual model errors, making the ensemble more robust than any single model

## Ensembles

- Ensemble methods are **widely used in industry** and dominate **machine learning competitions** (e.g., Kaggle).  
- In this course, we'll explore  
- **Tree-based ensembles:**  
    - Random Forests  
    - Gradient Boosted Trees (at a high level)
    
- **Ways to combine models:**  
    - **Averaging:** combine model outputs directly  
    - **Stacking:** use one model to learn how to combine others  

## When do ensembles help?

In which of these scenarios does an ensemble improve performance?

## When do ensembles help?

Ensembles improve performance when the individual models are both **competent** (have expertise) and **make different kinds of errors** (are diverse).  


## Diversity

- Ensembles work best when their models make **different types of mistakes**.  
- If all models make the same errors, averaging won't help.  
- We can **encourage diversity** by:
  - Introducing randomness (e.g., bootstrapped samples and random feature subsets (*Random Forests*))
  - Sequentially focusing on previous errors (e.g., *Gradient Boosting*)  

## Expertise

- Diversity alone is not enough. Individual models should still have **some predictive skill**.  
- If each model performs poorly (worse than random), the ensemble can't recover.  
- Best ensembles strike a **balance** between:
  - **Diversity:** models disagree in useful ways  
  - **Expertise:** each model performs better than chance

# Random forest 

## What can we randomize between trees?
![](img/tree-example.png)

## Two sources of randomness in random forests

- **Bootstrap sampling of data**  
  Each tree is trained on a slightly different dataset â†’ decorrelates trees.
- **Random subset of features at each split**  
  Each split considers only a random subset of features â†’ further reduces correlation.


## Bootstrap sample {.smaller}
- Ensures trees **see different versions of the data**  
- Creates **diversity** while preserving **similar overall structure**

## Random subset of features at each split

- The second source of randomness comes from **selecting a different subset of features at every split**  
- Each tree now explores different parts of the feature space  
- ðŸ¤” But why not pick one subset per tree instead?

## Why use a new subset at each split? {.smaller}

| Strategy | Diversity | Expertise | Issue |
|-----------|------------|------------|--------|
| One subset per tree | Very high | Often low | May miss important features |
| New subset per split | Moderate | High | Stronger, less correlated trees |

- Using a new subset per split strikes a **balance** between diversity and strength  
- Prevents trees from becoming too weak while still keeping them different

> "Random selection of features at each node gives substantial additional accuracy gains over bagging alone."  
> â€” *Breiman (2001)*

## Interim summary
- Random Forests reduce overfitting by **decorrelating trees**
- Two ingredients make this happen: Random data (bootstrapping) and random features (per split)  
- Together, they build a strong yet diverse ensemble
