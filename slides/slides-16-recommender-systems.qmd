## Announcements

- HW6 was due yesterday. 
- No classes or OH during the midterm break.
- Midterm 2 coming up next week! 
- If you find the breathing exercises helpful, you’re very welcome to join our weekly meditation sessions.
  - 🕑 When? **Every Wednesdays at 2 PM**
  - 📍 Where? **ICCS 146** 

## iClicker question 💡 

What percentage of watch time on YouTube do you think comes from recommendations?

- (A) 50%
- (B) 60%
- (C) 20%
- (D) 90%

Based on [Google Developers (2022)](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/overview). The number may have changed since then!

## What is a recommendation system? 

A recommendation system suggests products, services, or content that a user is likely to consume or enjoy.

## Example: Recommender systems

- A user visits Amazon to shop.
- Amazon knows:
  - what the user viewed or purchased before
  - what similar users bought
- **The goal:** recommend items that maximize user engagement or sales.
- There's no single "right" label. The goal is to model user behaviour.

## Why should we care?

- Recommendations shape almost everything we buy or watch.
- Central to the success of companies like Amazon, Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify.

## Why recommendation systems? {.smaller}

- They help users navigate information overload.
- Without them, finding the right item would require sifting through thousands of options.
- Recommendations reduce effort and improve user experience.

## The other side: Filter bubbles 
- Recommenders often amplify what users already like or what similar users like.
- This can create filter bubbles, limiting exposure to diverse content.
- Probably harmless in shopping, but can have **serious consequences in domains like news, politics, or science, where diverse viewpoints matter**.

# Data and problem setup 

## What data do we need?

To build a recommender, we typically use:

- User–item interactions (ratings, clicks, views, purchases)
- Item or user features (e.g., genre, price, age)
- Historical data (purchase or viewing history)

## Problem formulation

- We have $N$ users and $M$ items.
- Observed data = interactions:
	- Movie ratings (Netflix)
	- Song plays (Spotify)
	- Product purchases (Amazon)

**Goal**: predict unobserved interactions.

## The utility matrix
- Rows = users, columns = items
- Each entry $y_{ij}$ = user $i$'s interaction (e.g., rating) with item $j$

<!-- <img src="img/utility_matrix.png" alt="" height="900" width="900">  -->


## Sparsity
- The utility matrix is mostly empty.
- Each user interacts with only a small fraction of all items.
- Examples:
  - Netflix users rate only a few shows out of thousands.
  - Amazon shoppers review only a handful of products.

## What do we predict?

We aim to fill in the missing entries. In other words, predict ratings or preferences the user hasn't expressed yet.

## Main approaches {.smaller}

- Collaborative filtering
    - "Unsupervised" learning 
    - We only have labels $y_{ij}$ (rating of user $i$ for item $j$). 
    - We learn latent features.  
- **Content-based recommenders** (today's focus)
    - Supervised learning
    - Extract features $x_i$ of users and/or items building a model to predict rating $y_i$ given $x_i$. 
    - Apply model to predict for new users/items. 
- Hybrid 
    - Combining collaborative filtering with content-based filtering

## iClicker Exercise {.smaller}
Select all of the following statements which are **True** 

- (A) In the context of recommendation systems, the shapes of validation utility matrix and train utility matrix are the same. 
- (B) RMSE perfectly captures what we want to measure in the context of recommendation systems. 
- (C) It would be reasonable to impute missing values in the utility matrix by taking the average of the ratings given to an item by similar users.  
- (D) In KNN type imputation, if a user has not rated any items yet, a reasonable strategy would be recommending them the most popular item. 


## iClicker Exercise 16.2 {.smaller}

Select all of the following statements which are **True**

(A) In content-based filtering we leverage available item features in addition to similarity between users.
(B) In content-based filtering you represent each user in terms of known features of items.
(C) In the set up of content-based filtering we discussed, if you have a new movie, you would have problems predicting ratings for that movie.
(D) In content-based filtering if a user has a number of ratings in the training utility matrix but does not have any ratings in the validation utility matrix then we won't be able to calculate RMSE for the validation utility matrix.
