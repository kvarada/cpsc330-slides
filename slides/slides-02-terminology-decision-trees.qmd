## Recap: What is ML? 

- ML uses data to build models that find patterns, make predictions, or generate content.
- It helps computers learn from data to make decisions.
- No one model works for every situation.

- (A) Identifying objects within digital images, such as facial recognition in security systems or categorizing images based on content.
- (B) Determining if individuals meet the necessary criteria for government or financial services based on strict guidelines.
- (C) Identifying unusual patterns that may indicate fraudulent transactions in banking and finance.
- (D) Automatically analyzing images from MRIs, CT scans, or X-rays to detect abnormalities like tumors or fractures.
- (E) Addressing mental health issues where human empathy, understanding, and adaptability are key.

## Recap: When is ML suitable?

- ML excels when the problem involve identifying complex patterns or relationships in large datasets that are difficult for humans to discern manually.
- Rule-based systems are suitable where clear and deterministic rules can be defined. Good for structured decision making. 
- Human experts are good with problems which require deep contextual understanding, ethical judgment, creative input, or emotional intelligence.

## Recap: Supervised learning {.smaller}

- We wish to find a model function $f$ that relates $X$ to $y$.
- We use the model function to predict targets of new examples. 

![](img/sup-learning.png){.nostretch fig-align="center" width="700px"}

In the first part of this course, we'll focus on supervised machine learning. 


## Unsupervised learning {.smaller}
- Training data consists of observations $X$ without any corresponding targets.
- Unsupervised learning could be used to group similar things together in $X$ or to find underlying structure in the data.

## Today's focus 

- ML Terminology
- Using sklearn to build a simple supervised ML model
- Intuition of Decision Trees

## Framework

- There are many frameworks to do do machine learning. 
- We'll mainly be using [`scikit-learn` framework](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). 

```{python}
import IPython
url = "https://scikit-learn.org"
IPython.display.IFrame(width=1000, height=650, src=url)
```

## Running example {.smaller}

Imagine you're in the fortunate situation where, after graduating, you have a few job offers and need to decide which one to choose. You want to pick the job that will likely make you the happiest. To help with your decision, you collect data from like-minded people. 

- Can you think of relevant features for this problem? 

## Toy job happinees dataset {.smaller}

Here are the first few rows of a toy dataset.

```{python}
#| echo: true
toy_happiness_df = pd.read_csv(DATA_DIR + 'toy_job_happiness.csv')
toy_happiness_df
```

# Terminology {.smaller}

## Features, target, example
::: panel-tabset
### Terminology 

- What are the **features** $X$? 
  - features = inputs = predictors = explanatory variables = regressors = independent variables = covariates 
- What's the target $y$?
  - target = output = outcome = response variable = dependent variable = labels 
- What is an example?

### Data {.smaller}

```{python}
toy_happiness_df
```
:::


## Classification vs. Regression
- Is this a **classification** problem or a **regression** problem?  

```{python}
toy_happiness_df
```

## (Optional) Inference vs. Prediction {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Inference** asks: *Why does something happen?*  
- Goal: **understand** and **quantify** the relationship between variables  
- Often involves estimating model parameters and testing hypotheses  
- Example: *Which factors influence happiness, and by how much?*  
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
- **Prediction** asks: *What will happen?*  
- Goal: **accurately predict the target** without needing to fully explain the relationships  
- Example: *Will you be happy in a particular job?*  
:::
::::

Of course these goals are related, and in many situations we need both. 

## Training {.smaller}
- In supervised ML, the goal is to learn a function that maps input features ($X$) to a target ($y$).
- The relationship between $X$ and $y$ is often complex, making it difficult to  define mathematically.
- We use algorithms to approximate this complex relationship between $X$ and $y$.
- **Training** is the process of applying an algorithm to learn the best function (or model) that maps $X$ to $y$. 
- In this course, I'll help you develop an intuition for how these models work and demonstrate how to use them in a machine learning pipeline.

## Error and accuracy

- Machine learning models are **not perfect**â€”they will make mistakes.  
- To judge whether a model is **useful**, we need to track its performance.  
- For classification problems, the most common (and default in `sklearn`) metric is **accuracy**:  

$$
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of correct predictions}}{\text{Total number of examples}}
$$

## Separating $X$ and $y$

- In order to train a model we need to separate $X$ and $y$ from the dataframe. 
```{python}
#| echo: true
X = toy_happiness_df.drop(columns=["happy?"]) # Extract the feature set by removing the target column "happy?"
y = toy_happiness_df["happy?"] # Extract the target variable "happy?"
```

## Baseline  {.smaller}
- Let's try a simplest algorithm of predicting the most popular target! 

```{python}
#| echo: true
from sklearn.dummy import DummyClassifier
model = DummyClassifier(strategy="most_frequent") # Initialize the DummyClassifier to always predict the most frequent class
model.fit(X, y) # Train the model on the feature set X and target variable y
toy_happiness_df['dummy_predictions'] = model.predict(X) # Add the predicted values as a new column in the dataframe
toy_happiness_df
```

# Decision trees intuition {.smaller}
- One intuitive way to build a model is by asking a series of **yes/no questions**, forming a tree.  
- Which question would help you best separate the **happy** and **unhappy** examples?

![](img/happy_unhappy_faces.png)

```{python}
pd.concat([X, y], axis=1)
```

## Which question is more effective? {.smaller}
::: panel-tabset
### Visual {.smaller}

![](img/decision_tree_intuition.png)

### Data {.smaller}

```{python}
pd.concat([X, y], axis=1)
```
:::

## What are we trying to learn? {.smaller}

- We want to learn which questions to ask and in what order.
- How many possible questions could we ask with these features?

```{python}
pd.concat([X, y], axis=1)
```

## Decision tree Training (high level) {.smaller}

- Training a decision tree is a search process: we look for the "best" tree among many possible ones.
- There are different algorithms for learning trees. [Check this out.](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree-algorithms-id3-c4-5-c5-0-and-cart) 
- At each step, we evaluate candidate questions using measures such as:
  - Information gain
  - Gini index
- The goal is to split the data into groups with greater certainty (more homogeneous outcomes).

## Decision tree with `sklearn`
Let's train a simple decision tree on our toy dataset using `sklearn` 

```{python}
#| echo: true
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier # import the classifier
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree

model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=1) # Create a class object
model.fit(X, y)
plot_tree(model, filled=True, feature_names = X.columns, class_names=["Happy", "Unhappy"], impurity = False, fontsize=12);

```

## Prediction {.smaller}
- Given a new example, how does a decision tree predict the class of this example?  
- What would be the prediction for the example below using the tree above? 
  - supportive_colleagues = 1, salary = 60000, coffee_machine = 0, vegan_boss = 1,  
```{python}
plot_tree(model, filled=True, feature_names = X.columns, class_names = ["Happy", "Unhappy"], impurity = False, fontsize=12);
```

## Prediction with `sklearn` {.smaller}
- What would be the prediction for the example below using the tree above? 
  - supportive_colleagues = 1, salary = 60000, free_coffee = 0, vegan_boss = 1,  
```{python}
#| echo: true
test_example = [[1, 60000, 0, 1]]
print("Model prediction: ", model.predict(test_example))
plot_tree(model, filled=True, feature_names = X.columns, class_names = ["Happy", "Unhappy"], impurity = False, fontsize=9);
```

## Parameters vs. Hyperparameters 
- Parameters 
  - The questions (features and thresholds) used to split the data at each node.
  - Example: salary <= 75000 at the root node  
- Hyperparameters
  - Settings that control tree growth, like `max_depth`, which limits how deep the tree can go.

## Decision boundary

- A decision boundary is the **line, curve, or surface** that separates classes.
- Points on one side $\rightarrow$ Model predicts Class Happy  
- Points on the other side $\rightarrow$ Model predicts Class Unhappy

## Decision boundary with `max_depth=1`
```{python}
X_subset = X[["supportive_colleagues", "salary"]]
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1, random_state=1)
model.fit(X_subset.values, y)
plot_tree_decision_boundary_and_tree(
    model, X_subset, y, x_label="supportive_colleagues", y_label="salary", fontsize=12, class_names = ["Happy", "Unhappy"]
)
```

## Decision boundary with `max_depth=2`
```{python}
X_subset = X[["supportive_colleagues", "salary"]]
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=1)
model.fit(X_subset.values, y)
plot_tree_decision_boundary_and_tree(
    model, X_subset, y, x_label="supportive_colleagues", y_label="salary", fontsize=12, class_names = ["Happy", "Unhappy"]
)
```

Select all of the following statements which are TRUE.

- (A) Change in features (i.e., binarizing features above) would change DummyClassifier predictions.
- (B) predict takes only X as argument whereas fit and score take both X and y as arguments.
- (C) For the decision tree algorithm to work, the feature values must be binary.
- (D) The prediction in a decision tree works by routing the example from the root to the leaf.
