## Recap: Logistic regression
- A **linear model used for binary classification** tasks. 
  - There is a variant of logistic regression called multinomial logistic regression for multiclass classification.
- Parameters: 
  - Coefficients (Weights): The model learns a coefficient or a weight associated with each feature that represents its importance.
  - Bias (Intercept): A constant term added to the linear combination of features and their coefficients.

## Recap: Logistic regression 
- The model computes a weighted sum of the input featuresâ€™ values, adjusted by their respective coefficients and the bias term.
- This weighted sum is passed through a sigmoid function to transform it into a probability score, indicating the likelihood of the input belonging to the "positive" class.

\begin{equation}
P_{hat} = \sigma\left(\sum_{i=1}^d w_i x_i + b\right) 
\end{equation}

- $P_{hat}$ is the predicted probability of the example belonging to the positive class. 
- $w_i$ is the learned weight associated with feature $i$
- $x_i$ is the value of the input feature $i$
- $b$ is the bias term 

## Recap: Logistic regression

- For a dataset with $d$ features, the decision boundary that 
separates the classes is a $d-1$ dimensional hyperplane.  
- Complexity hyperparameter: `C` in `sklearn`. 
  - Higher `C` $\rightarrow$ more complex model meaning larger coefficients
  - Lower `C` $\rightarrow$ less complex model meaning smaller coefficients


## Recap: `CountVectorizer` input 

- Primarily designed to accept either a `pandas.Series` of text data or a 1D `numpy` array. It can also process a list of string data directly.
- Unlike many transformers that handle multiple features (`DataFrame` or 2D `numpy` array), `CountVectorizer` a single text column at a time.
- If your dataset contains multiple text columns, you will need to instantiate separate `CountVectorizer` objects for each text feature.
- This approach ensures that the unique vocabulary and tokenization processes are correctly applied to each specific text column without interference.

## Data

```{python}
#| echo: true
sms_df = pd.read_csv(DATA_DIR + "spam.csv", encoding="latin-1")
sms_df = sms_df.drop(columns = ["Unnamed: 2", "Unnamed: 3", "Unnamed: 4"])
sms_df = sms_df.rename(columns={"v1": "target", "v2": "sms"})
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(sms_df, test_size=0.10, random_state=42)
X_train, y_train = train_df["sms"], train_df["target"]
X_test, y_test = test_df["sms"], test_df["target"]
train_df.head(4)
```

## Model building 

- Let's define a pipeline 

```{python}
#| echo: true

pipe_svm = make_pipeline(CountVectorizer(), SVC())
```

- Suppose we want to try out different hyperparameter values. 
```{python}
#| echo: true

parameters = {
    "max_features": [100, 200, 400],
    "gamma": [0.01, 0.1, 1.0],
    "C": [0.01, 0.1, 1.0],
}
```

## Hyperparameter optimization with loops

- Define a parameter space.
- Iterate through possible combinations.
- Evaluate model performance.
- What are some limitations of this approach? 


## `sklearn` methods 

- `sklearn` provides two main methods for hyperparameter optimization
  - Grid Search
  - Random Search

## Grid Search 

- Covers all possible combinations from the provided grid. 
- Can be parallelized easily.
- Integrates cross-validation.


## Grid search example 
```{python}
#| echo: true

from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

pipe_svm = make_pipeline(CountVectorizer(), SVC())

param_grid = {
    "countvectorizer__max_features": [100, 200, 400],
    "svc__gamma": [0.01, 0.1, 1.0],
    "svc__C": [0.01, 0.1, 1.0],
}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(pipe_svm, 
                  param_grid = param_grid, 
                  n_jobs=-1, 
                  return_train_score=True
                 )
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
grid_search.best_score_
```


## Random Search 
- More efficient than grid search when dealing with large hyperparameter spaces.
- Samples a given number of parameter settings from distributions.

## Random search example 

```{python}
#| echo: true

from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from scipy.stats import randint

pipe_svc = make_pipeline(CountVectorizer(), SVC())

param_dist = {
    "countvectorizer__max_features": randint(100, 2000), 
    "svc__C": uniform(0.1, 1e4),  # loguniform(1e-3, 1e3),
    "svc__gamma": loguniform(1e-5, 1e3),
}
random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(pipe_svm,                                    
                  param_distributions = param_dist, 
                  n_iter=10, 
                  n_jobs=-1, 
                  return_train_score=True)

# Carry out the search
random_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
random_search.best_score_
```

## Optimization bias 

- Why do we need separate validation and test datasets? 

![](img/optimization-bias.png)

## Mitigating optimization bias.
  - Cross-validation
  - Ensembles 
  - Regularization and choosing a simpler model  


## (iClicker) Exercise 8.1

iClicker cloud join link: **https://join.iclicker.com/VYFJ**

Select all of the following statements which are TRUE.

- (A) If you get best results at the edges of your parameter grid, it might be a good idea to adjust the range of values in your parameter grid.
- (B) Grid search is guaranteed to find the best hyperparameter values.
- (C) It is possible to get different hyperparameters in different runs of RandomizedSearchCV.

## Questions for you

- You have a dataset and you give me 1/10th of it. The dataset given to me is rather small and so I split it into 96% train and 4% validation split. I carry out hyperparameter optimization using a single 4% validation split and report validation accuracy of 0.97. Would it classify the rest of the data with similar accuracy?
  - Probably
  - Probably not


## Questions for class discussion

- Suppose you have 10 hyperparameters, each with 4 possible values. If you run `GridSearchCV` with this parameter grid, how many cross-validation experiments will be carried out? 
- Suppose you have 10 hyperparameters and each takes 4 values. If you run `RandomizedSearchCV` with this parameter grid with `n_iter=20`, how many cross-validation experiments will be carried out?
