::: {.column width="60%"}
Eva is among one of you. She has some experience in Python programming. She knows machine learning as a buzz word. During her recent internship, she has developed some interest and curiosity in the field. She wants to learn what is it and how to use it. She is a curious person and usually has a lot of questions!  
:::

::::

## You all

- Introduce yourself to your neighbour. 
- Since we're going to spend the semester with each other, I would like to know you a bit better. 
- Please fill out [Getting to know you survey](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/170662/quizzes/897830) when you get a chance.

## Asking questions during class {.smaller}

- You are encouraged to ask questions by raising your hand.
- No question is a stupid question. 
- Recommended reading as you begin your learning journey: [The Fear of Publicly Not Knowing](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/the-fear-of-publicly-not-knowing-239e1b7a39f3)

> What I quickly came to realize was that publicly not knowing wasn't a indicator of stupidity, it was an indicator of understanding. And from what I‚Äôve seen, it is one of the clearest indicators of success in people ‚Äî more than school prestige, more than GPA.

## Activity 1
\
Discuss with you neighbour

- What do you know about machine learning?
- What would you like to get out this course?
- Are there any particular topics or aspects of this course that you are especially excited or anxious about? Why?

## What are AI, ML, DL? {.smaller}
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Making computers act smart  
  - Examples: [Deep Blue](https://www.ibm.com/history/deep-blue), early spell checkers
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Learning patterns from data
  - Example: Spam filtering in Gmail 
- **Deep Learning (DL)**: Using neural networks to learn complex patterns
  - Examples: Face recognition in your phone, voice assistants

## Let's walk through an example 

- Have you used search in Google Photos? You can search for "cat" and it will retrieve photos from your libraries containing cats.
- This can be done using **image classification**. 

## Image classification {.smaller}
- Imagine we want a system that can tell cats and foxes apart.
- How might we do this with traditional programming? With ML?

## Traditional programming: example

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](img/cat-or-fox.png) 
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- You hard-code rules. If all of the following satisfy, it's a fox.     
    - pointed face ‚úÖ
    - red fur ‚úÖ
    - narrow eyes ‚úÖ    
- This works for normal cases, but what if there are exceptions
::: 

::::

## ML approach: example

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](img/cat-or-fox.png) 
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- We don't tell the model the exact rule. Instead, we give it many labeled images, and it learns probabilistic patterns across multiple features, not rigid rules.
    - If fur is red $\rightarrow$ 90% chance of Fox.

::: 

::::

## DL approach: example 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](img/cat-or-fox.png) 
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- A neural network automatically learns which features to look at (edges $\rightarrow$ textures $\rightarrow$ objects).
- No need to even specify face shape or fur colour. It learns relevant features on its own. 
::: 

::::

## What is ML?  

- ML uses algorithms to learn patterns from data and build models.  
- These models can:  
  - Make predictions on new data  
  - Support complex decisions  
  - Generate new content  
- ML systems can improve when trained on more data.  
- There is no one-size-fits-all model. The right choice depends on the problem.  


## When to use ML? 

- When the problem can't be solved with a fixed set of rules
- When you have **lots of data** and **complex relationships**
- When human decision-making is too slow or inconsistent

| Approach                 | Best for                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Traditional Programming  | Rules are known, data is clean/predictable |
| Machine Learning         | Rules are complex/unknown, data is noisy  |

# When to use Machine Learning (ML) solutions? 

## Example: Supervised classification {.smaller}
- We want to predict liver disease from tabular features:
```{python}
df = pd.read_csv(DATA_DIR + "indian_liver_patient.csv")
df = df.drop(columns=["Gender"])
df["Dataset"] = df["Dataset"].replace(1, "Disease")
df["Dataset"] = df["Dataset"].replace(2, "No Disease")
df.rename(columns={"Dataset": "Target"}, inplace=True)
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(df, test_size=4, random_state=42)
X_train = train_df.drop(columns=["Target"])
y_train = train_df["Target"]
X_test = test_df.drop(columns=["Target"])
y_test = test_df["Target"]
HTML(train_df.head().to_html(index=False))
```

## Model training 
```{python}
#| echo: true
from lightgbm.sklearn import LGBMClassifier
model = LGBMClassifier(random_state=123, verbose=-1)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## New examples 

- Given features of new patients below we'll use this model to predict whether these patients have the liver disease or not.
```{python}
HTML(X_test.reset_index(drop=True).to_html(index=False))
```

## Model predictions on new examples {.smaller}
- Let's examine predictions

```{python}
#| echo: true
pred_df = pd.DataFrame({"Predicted_target": model.predict(X_test).tolist()})
df_concat = pd.concat([pred_df, X_test.reset_index(drop=True)], axis=1)
HTML(df_concat.to_html(index=False))
```

## Example: Supervised regression {.smaller}

Suppose we want to predict housing prices given a number of attributes associated with houses. The target here is **continuous** and not **discrete**. 

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv( DATA_DIR + "kc_house_data.csv")
df = df.drop(columns = ["id", "date"])
df.rename(columns={"price": "target"}, inplace=True)
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=4)
HTML(train_df.head().to_html(index=False))
```

## Building a regression model

```{python}
#| echo: true
from lightgbm.sklearn import LGBMRegressor

X_train, y_train = train_df.drop(columns= ["target"]), train_df["target"]
X_test, y_test = test_df.drop(columns= ["target"]), train_df["target"]

model = LGBMRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train);
```

## Predicting prices of unseen houses {.smaller}

```{python}
#| echo: true
pred_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {"Predicted_target": model.predict(X_test[0:4]).tolist()}
)
df_concat = pd.concat([pred_df, X_test[0:4].reset_index(drop=True)], axis=1)
HTML(df_concat.to_html(index=False))
```
We are predicting **continuous values** here as apposed to discrete values in `disease` vs. `no disease` example. 


# Text data 

## Example: Text classification {.smaller}

- Suppose you are given some data with labeled spam and non-spam messages and you want to predict whether a new message is spam or not spam.  

::: panel-tabset
### Code

```{python}
#| echo: true
sms_df = pd.read_csv(DATA_DIR + "spam.csv", encoding="latin-1")
sms_df = sms_df.drop(columns = ["Unnamed: 2", "Unnamed: 3", "Unnamed: 4"])
sms_df = sms_df.rename(columns={"v1": "target", "v2": "sms"})
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(sms_df, test_size=0.10, random_state=42)
```

### Output {.smaller}

::: {.scroll-container style="overflow-y: scroll; height: 400px;"}

```{python}
HTML(train_df.head().to_html(index=False))
```
:::
:::

## Let's train a model 

```{python}
#| echo: true
X_train, y_train = train_df["sms"], train_df["target"]
X_test, y_test = test_df["sms"], test_df["target"]
clf = make_pipeline(CountVectorizer(max_features=5000), LogisticRegression(max_iter=5000))
clf.fit(X_train, y_train) # Training the model
```

## Unseen messages {.smaller}

- Now use the trained model to predict targets of unseen messages:

```{python}
pd.DataFrame(X_test[0:4])
```

## Predicting on unseen data {.smaller}

**The model is accurately predicting labels for the unseen text messages above!**

```{python}
pred_dict = {
    "sms": X_test[0:4],
    "spam_predictions": clf.predict(X_test[0:4]),
}
pred_df = pd.DataFrame(pred_dict)
pred_df.style.set_properties(**{"text-align": "left"})
```

## Examplel: Text classification with LLMs
\ 

- LLMs = Large Language Models

```{python}
#| echo: true
from transformers import pipeline, AutoModelForTokenClassification, AutoTokenizer
# Sentiment analysis pipeline
analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model='distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english')
analyzer(["I asked my model to predict my future, and it said '404: Life not found.'",
          '''Machine learning is just like cooking‚Äîsometimes you follow the recipe, 
            and other times you just hope for the best!.'''])
```


## Zero-shot learning {.smaller}
\

- Now suppose you want to identify the emotion expressed in the text rather than just positive or negative. 

::: {.scroll-container style="overflow-y: scroll; height: 400px;"}
```{python}
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("dair-ai/emotion")
exs = dataset["test"]["text"][0:10]
exs
```
:::

## Zero-shot learning for emotion detection 
\

```{python}
#| echo: true
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from transformers import pipeline 
import torch

#Load the pretrained model
model_name = "facebook/bart-large-mnli"
classifier = pipeline('zero-shot-classification', model=model_name)
exs = dataset["test"]["text"][10:20]
candidate_labels = ["sadness", "joy", "love","anger", "fear", "surprise"]
outputs = classifier(exs, candidate_labels)
```

## Zero-shot learning for emotion detection {.smaller}
\

::: {.scroll-container style="overflow-y: scroll; height: 400px;"}
```{python}
pd.DataFrame(outputs)
```

# Image data

## Example: Predicting labels of a given image {.smaller}
- Suppose you have a bunch of animal images. You do not have any labels associated with them and you want to predict labels of these images. 
- We can use machine learning to predict labels of these images using a technique called **transfer learning**. 

::: {.scroll-container style="overflow-y: scroll; height: 400px;"}

```{python}
import img_classify
from PIL import Image
import glob
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Predict topn labels and their associated probabilities for unseen images
images = glob.glob(DATA_DIR + "test_images/*.*")
class_labels_file = DATA_DIR + 'imagenet_classes.txt'
for img_path in images:
    img = Image.open(img_path).convert('RGB')
    img.load()
    plt.imshow(img)
    plt.show();    
    df = img_classify.classify_image(img_path, class_labels_file)
    print(df.to_string(index=False))
    print("--------------------------------------------------------------")
```
:::
:::

# Clustering images
## Finding groups in food images 
\
```{python}
data_dir = "data/food/train"
file_names = [image_file for image_file in glob.glob(data_dir + "/*/*.jpg")]
n_images = len(file_names)
BATCH_SIZE = n_images  # because our dataset is quite small
food_inputs, food_classes = read_img_dataset(data_dir, BATCH_SIZE)
X_food = food_inputs.numpy()
plot_sample_imgs(food_inputs[0:24,:,:,:])
```

## K-Means on food dataset
\

```{python}
#| echo: true
densenet = models.densenet121(weights="DenseNet121_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1")
densenet.classifier = torch.nn.Identity()  # remove that last "classification" layer
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
Z_food = get_features_unsup(densenet, food_inputs)
k = 5
km = KMeans(n_clusters=k, n_init='auto', random_state=123)
km.fit(Z_food)
```

## Examining food clusters
\

::: {.scroll-container style="overflow-y: scroll; height: 400px;"}

```{python}
#| echo: true
for cluster in range(k):
    get_cluster_images(km, Z_food, X_food, cluster, n_img=6)

# Interactive: Is ML appropriate?

## ‚ùì‚ùì Questions for you

iClicker cloud join link: https://join.iclicker.com/FZMQ

**Select all that apply: Which problems are suitable for ML?**

- (A) Checking if a UBC email address ends with @student.ubc.ca before allowing login
- (B) Deciding which students should be awarded a scholarship based on their personal essays
- (C) Predicting which songs you'll like based on your Spotify listening history
- (D) Detecting plagiarism by checking if two essays are exactly identical
- (E) Automatically tagging photos of your friends on Instagram

## Summary: When is ML suitable?

| **Approach**     | **Best Used When...**                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Machine Learning** | The dataset is **large and complex**, and the decision rules are **unknown, fuzzy, or too complex to define explicitly** |
| **Rule-based System** | The logic is **clear and deterministic**, and the rules or thresholds are **known and stable** |
| **Human Expert**  | The problem involves **ethics, creativity, emotion, or ambiguity** that can't be formalized easily |

## Activity 2 

Think of a problem you have come across in the past which could be solved using machine learning. 

- What would be the input and output? 
- How do humans solve this now? Are there heuristics or rules?
- What kind of data do you have or could you collect?

## Types of machine learning

Here are some typical learning problems. 

- **Supervised learning** ([Gmail spam filtering](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2368132?hl=en))
- **Unsupervised learning** ([Google News](https://news.google.com/))
- Reinforcement learning ([AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far))
- Generative AI ([ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/))
- **Recommendation systems** ([Amazon item recommendation system](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/Amazon-Recommendations.pdf))

## What is supervised learning? {.smaller}

- Training data comprises a set of observations ($X$) and their corresponding targets ($y$). 
- We wish to find a model function $f$ that relates $X$ to $y$.
- We use the model function to predict targets of new examples. 

![](img/sup-learning.png){.nostretch fig-align="center" width="700px"}

## ü§î Eva's questions {.smaller}
\

At this point, Eva is wondering about many questions. 

- How are we exactly "learning" whether a message is spam and ham? 
- Are we expected to get correct predictions for all possible messages? How does it predict the label for a message it has not seen before?  
- What if the model mis-labels an unseen example? For instance, what if the model incorrectly predicts a non-spam as a spam? What would be the consequences? 
- How do we measure the success or failure of spam identification? 
- If you want to use this model in the wild, how do you know how reliable it is?  
- Would it be useful to know how confident the model is about the predictions rather than just a yes or a no?

It's great to think about these questions right now. But Eva has to be patient. By the end of this course you'll know answers to many of these questions!

## CPSC 330 vs. 340

Read [330_vs_340](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W1/blob/main/docs/330_vs_340.md) which explains the difference between two courses.  

**TLDR:**

- 340: how do ML models work?
- 330: how do I use ML models?
- CPSC 340 has many prerequisites. 
- CPSC 340 goes deeper but has a more narrow scope.
- I think CPSC 330 will be more useful if you just plan to apply basic ML.

## Course calendar

Here is our course Calendar. Make sure you check it on a regular basis: 

[https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W1/blob/main/docs/calendar.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W1/blob/main/docs/calendar.html)


## Lecture format

- In person lectures T/Th.
- Sometimes there will be videos to watch before lecture. You will find the list of pre-watch videos in the schedule on the course webpage.
- We will also try to work on some questions and exercises together during the class. 
- All materials will be posted in this GitHub repository. 

## Tutorials 
- Weekly tutorials will be run by the TAs. 

- There is a small bonus grade associated with attending tutorials.

## Lecture notes {.smaller}

- A draft version of lecture notes is available in [this Jupyter book](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W1/README.html)
- We A "finalized" version will be pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W1) and the [Jupyter book](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W1/README.html) right before each class.
- Each instructor will have slightly adapted versions of notes to present slides during lectures.  
- You will find the link to these slides in our repository: 
https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W1/tree/main/lectures/102-Varada-lectures
- All the lectures from last year are [available here](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2024W1/README.html).
- We cannot promise anything will stay the same from last year to this year, so read them in advance at your own risk.

## Registration, waitlist and prerequisites {.smaller}

::: {.callout-important}
Please go through [this document](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W1/blob/master/docs/course_info.md#registration) carefully before contacting your instructors about these issues. Even then, we are very unlikely to be able to help with registration, waitlist or prerequisite issues.
:::

- There are still seats available in Section 103.
- If you are on the waitlist and would like to try your chances, you should already have access to Piazza and Gradescope.
- **Please note that it is your responsibility to complete and submit all assessments while you are on the waitlist. No concessions will be made for students who are waitlisted.**
- If you are unable to secure a seat this term, the course will be offered again with two sections next semester, and once more in the summer.

:::{.callout-note}
We do not have time to teach all the Python we need 
but you can find some useful Python resources [here](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W1/blob/main/docs/resources.md).

## Workload 
What does a typical week look like?

- **Before class:** Watch pre-lecture videos or preview notes  
- **In class:** Two 80-minute lectures with iClicker questions, activities, and live demos  
- **Support:** Weekly tutorials and office hours  

- **Practice:** Weekly assignments (except exam weeks)  

## Tips for success:

- Attend lectures regularly and ask questions  
- Start homework early. Hands-on practice is essential  

- Use Generative AI tools **responsibly**. No blind copy-pasting  

- Always question your data, methods, and results ‚Äî justify your choices  

# Course policies 

## Attendance {.smaller}

Raise your hand if you‚Äôve ever

- Learned something important just from overhearing a classmate‚Äôs question
- Suddenly ‚Äúgot it‚Äù because of something the instructor said or showed that wasn‚Äôt written in the slides üí°
- Made a good friend or professional connection just by showing up in a classroom ü§ù
- Felt more motivated when the room around you was engaged 

Your presence and engagement matters!! Together we create energy that makes lectures valuable! 

## Grading scheme 

- The grading breakdown is [here](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W1/blob/main/syllabus.md#grading-scheme). 

- The policy on challenging grades is [here](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W1/blob/main/docs/grades.md).


## Exams 

Two midterms and a final exam all on PrairieLearn in Computer-based Testing Facility (CBTF).

- Midterm 1: Conceptual. Multiple choice, multi-select, and reasoning questions.

- Midterm 2: Includes some coding.

- Final exam: A mix of question types covering the full course.

## Homework assignmnts {.smaller}

- Our notes are created in a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/), with file extension `.ipynb`.
- Also, you will complete your homework assignments using Jupyter notebooks.
- Confusingly, "Jupyter notebook" is also the original application that opens `.ipynb` files - but has since been replaced by **Jupyter Lab**.
  - I am using Jupyter Lab, some things might not work with the Jupyter notebook application.
  - You can also open these files in Visual Studio Code.

## Jupyter notebooks 

- Notebooks contain a mix of code, code output, markdown-formatted text (including LaTeX equations), and more.
- When you open a Jupyter notebook in one of these apps, the document is ‚Äúlive‚Äù, meaning you can run the code.

For example:

```{python}
#| echo: true
1 + 1
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
x = [1, 2, 3]
x[0] = 9999
x
```

## Jupyter 

- By default, Jupyter prints out the result of the last line of code, so you don't need as many `print` statements.
- In addition to the "live" notebooks, Jupyter notebooks can be statically rendered in the web browser, e.g. [this](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2025W1/blob/main/lectures/01_intro.ipynb).
  - This can be convenient for quick read-only access, without needing to launch the Jupyter notebook/lab application.
  - But you need to launch the app properly to interact with the notebooks.

## Important note 
- Note that your first homework assignment is due **this coming Tuesday, September 9, 11:59 PM**. This is a relatively straightforward assignment on Python. 
- If you struggle with this assignment then that could be a sign that you will struggle later on in the course.    
- You must do the first two homework assignments on your own.


## Plagiarism 

Raise your hand if you've ever copied code from StackOverflow.

## Using generative AI in this course {.smaller}
**Please read our [full Generative AI usage policy](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W1/syllabus.html#use-of-generative-ai-in-the-course).**

TL;DR: use AI to support, not substitute, your work. If you use a tool:

- Cite it (tool name/version).
- Annotate your use (what you asked it to do and how you incorporated/edited the output).
- Be able to explain and reproduce your work without the tool.
- Do not share sensitive content (e.g., assessments, private data).
- Follow group-work rules and be extra careful when collaborating.
- You are responsible for any errors (‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù) the tool produces.

## (Optional) Slides on LLM usage

Check out these slides I've put together for [GenAI usage during your learning journey](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13IZMwnfC6YAeS6-bVF2S2CRYMSKZtTprMMaENuhkb04/edit?usp=sharing
).
