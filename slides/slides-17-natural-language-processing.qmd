## Focus on the breath!

## Announcements

- No classes next week.
- Midterm 2 coming up next week. 
- Do you need OH to get ready for the midterm? If yes, I can hold OH on Monday. 


## iClicker question 

Do you need office hours to help you prepare for the midterm?

- (A) Monday at 2 PM works well for me
- (B) Monday at 4 PM works well for me
- (C) No, I don't need office hours

sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.abspath("."), "code"))

_Imagine that you recently watched **Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things (2015)** and rated it highly._

```{python}
from IPython.display import YouTubeVideo
video_id = "0Co1Iptd4p4"
YouTubeVideo(video_id, width=500, height=450)
```

Suppose a recommendation system suggests items based on item similarity. Which movie would be recommended to you?

- A) 🎬 Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) (Highly popular sci-fi movie with themes of nature and connection.)

- B) 🎬 The Art of Effortless Living (2021) (A lesser-known documentary about mindfulness and simple living.)

## Similarity metrics {.smaller}
- Similarity based on Euclidean distance

$$distance(vec1, vec2) = \sqrt{\sum_{i =1}^{n} (vec1_i - vec2_i)^2}$$ 

- Dot product similarity: 

$$similarity_{dot product}(vec1,vec2) = vec1.vec2$$

- Cosine similarity: normalized version of dot product. 

$$similarity_{cosine}(vec1,vec2) = \frac{vec1.vec2}{\left\lVert vec1\right\rVert_2 \left\lVert vec2\right\rVert_2}$$


## Which metric in what context? {.smaller}

Given a query vector "Query" in the picture below and the three item vectors, determine the ranking of the items for the three similarity measures below:

- Example: Similarity based on Euclidean distance: item B > item C > item A

- **Similarity based on dot product: ?**
  
**- Cosine similarity: ?**

## What is NLP?

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a field at the intersection of **computer science, linguistics, and artificial intelligence**.  
- It focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

## Examples of NLP applications

![](img/annotation-image.png)

## Key challenges in NLP

- **Ambiguity**: words can have multiple meanings and meaning depends on previous words/sentences
  - I had toast with _jam_ vs We got stuck in a traffic _jam_.
  - If the **baby** does not thrive on raw **milk**, boil **it**.  
- **Structure**: syntax and grammar vary widely
  - Time flies like an arrow vs Fruit flies like a banana.   
- **World knowledge**: understanding beyond text
  - Olive oil: oil **made from** olives 
  - Baby oil: oil **made for** babies 

## Goal of this lecture

NLP is a broad field. In this lecture I'll give you a high-level introduction to 

- Topic Modeling
- Word embeddings 
- Language models and large language models
