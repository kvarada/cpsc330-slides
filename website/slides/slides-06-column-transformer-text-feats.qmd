# Recap: Preprocessing mistakes

## Data 
```{python}
#| echo: true

# make synthetic data
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=100, centers=3, random_state=12, cluster_std=5)
# split it into training and test sets
X_train_toy, X_test_toy, y_train_toy, y_test_toy = train_test_split(
    X, y, random_state=5, test_size=0.4)
plt.scatter(X_train_toy[:, 0], X_train_toy[:, 1], label="Training set", s=60)
plt.scatter(
    X_test_toy[:, 0], X_test_toy[:, 1], color=mglearn.cm2(1), label="Test set", s=60
)
plt.legend(loc="upper right")
```

## Recap: Bad methodology 1
- What's wrong with scaling data separately? 

```{python}
#| echo: true
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(X_train_toy)
train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train_toy)

scaler = StandardScaler()  # Creating a separate object for scaling test data
scaler.fit(X_test_toy)  # Calling fit on the test data
test_scaled = scaler.transform(
    X_test_toy
)  # Transforming the test data using the scaler fit on test data

knn = KNeighborsClassifier()
knn.fit(train_scaled, y_train_toy)
print(f"Training score: {knn.score(train_scaled, y_train_toy):.2f}")
print(f"Test score: {knn.score(test_scaled, y_test_toy):.2f}")
```

## Scaling train and test data separately

```{python}
plot_original_scaled(
    X_train_toy,
    X_test_toy,
    train_scaled,
    test_scaled,
    title_transformed="Improperly transformed",
)
```

## Recap: Bad methodology 2 
- What's wrong with scaling the data together

```{python}
#| echo: true
# join the train and test sets back together
XX = np.vstack((X_train_toy, X_test_toy))

scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(XX)
XX_scaled = scaler.transform(XX)

XX_train = XX_scaled[:X_train_toy.shape[0]]
XX_test = XX_scaled[X_train_toy.shape[0]:]

knn = KNeighborsClassifier()
knn.fit(XX_train, y_train_toy)
print(f"Training score: {knn.score(XX_train, y_train_toy):.2f}")  # Misleading score
print(f"Test score: {knn.score(XX_test, y_test_toy):.2f}")  # Misleading score
```


## Bad methodology 3 (class discussion)

- What's wrong here? 
```{python}
#| echo: true
knn = KNeighborsClassifier()

scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(X_train_toy)
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train_toy)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test_toy)
scores = cross_validate(knn, X_train_scaled, y_train_toy, return_train_score=True)
pd.DataFrame(scores)
```

## Recap: `sklearn` Pipelines

- Pipeline is a way to chain multiple steps (e.g., preprocessing + model fitting) into a single workflow.
- Simplify the code and improves readability.
- Reduce the risk of data leakage by ensuring proper transformation of the training and test sets.
- Automatically apply transformations in sequence.

### Example:
Chaining a `StandardScaler` with a `KNeighborsClassifier` model.

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

pipeline = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), KNeighborsClassifier())

pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)
```

## `sklearn`'s `ColumnTransformer` 

- Use ColumnTransformer to build all our transformations together into one object 

![](img/column-transformer.png)

- Use a column transformer with sklearn pipelines. 

## Ordinal encoding vs. One-hot encoding

- Ordinal Encoding: Encodes categorical features as an integer array.
- One-hot Encoding: Creates binary columns for each category’s presence.
- Sometimes how we encode a specific feature depends upon the context.  

## Ordinal encoding vs. One-hot encoding
- Consider **weather** feature and its four levels: ['Sunny', 'Cloudy', 'Rainy', 'Snowy']
- **Predicting traffic volume:** Using one-hot encoding would make sense here because the impact of different weather conditions on traffic volume does not necessarily follow a clear order and different weather conditions could have very distinct effects.
- **Predicting severity of weather-related road incidents:** An ordinal encoding might be more appropriate if you define your weather categories from least to most severe as this could correlate directly with the likelihood or severity of incidents.

## `handle_unknown = "ignore"` of `OneHotEncoder` 
- Using `handle_unknown='ignore'` with `OneHotEncoder` to safely ignore unseen categories during transform.
- Is this a good approach in all scenarios? 

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')
```


## `drop="if_binary"` argument of OneHotEncoder

- drop='if_binary' argument in OneHotEncoder:
- Reduces redundancy by dropping one of the columns if the feature is binary.


## Categorical variables with too many categories
- Strategies for categorical variables with too many categories:
- Dimensionality reduction techniques
- Bucketing categories into ‘others’

## Dealing with text features 
- Preprocessing text to fit into machine learning models using text vectorization.
- Bag of words representation 
![](img/bag-of-words.png)

## `sklearn` `CountVectorizer`
- Use `scikit-learn`’s CountVectorizer to encode text data
- CountVectorizer: Transforms text into a matrix of token counts

- Important parameters:
	  - `max_df`, `min_df`: Control document frequency thresholds.
	  - `ngram_range`: Defines the range of n-grams to be extracted.

## Incorporating text features in a machine learning pipeline
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

text_pipeline = make_pipeline(
    CountVectorizer(),
    SVC()
)
```

## (iClicker) Exercise 6.1
iClicker cloud join link: **https://join.iclicker.com/VYFJ**

**Select all of the following statements which are TRUE.**

- (A) You could carry out cross-validation by passing a `ColumnTransformer` object to `cross_validate`.
- (B) After applying column transformer, the order of the columns in the transformed data has to be the same as the order of the columns in the original data.
- (C) After applying a column transformer, the transformed data is always going to be of different shape than the original data.
- (D) When you call `fit_transform` on a `ColumnTransformer` object, you get a numpy ndarray.


## (iClicker) Exercise 6.2
iClicker cloud join link: **https://join.iclicker.com/VYFJ**

Select all of the following statements which are TRUE.

- (A) `handle_unknown="ignore"` would treat all unknown categories equally.
- (B) As you increase the value for `max_features` hyperparameter of `CountVectorizer` the training score is likely to go up.
- (C) Suppose you are encoding text data using `CountVectorizer`. If you encounter a word in the validation or the test split that's not available in the training data, we'll get an error.
- (D) In the code below, inside `cross_validate`, each fold might have slightly different number of features (columns) in the fold.

```python
pipe = (CountVectorizer(), SVC())
cross_validate(pipe, X_train, y_train)
```
