**Select all of the following statements which are TRUE.**

- (A) In multinomial logistic regression, the model learns a separate weight vector and bias for each class.
- (B) Neural networks are powerful models, so it's usually a good idea to start with them on any new machine learning problem.
- (C) The main reason we add hidden layers is to allow the model to learn increasingly complex representations.
- (D) Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use filters that slide over the image to detect local patterns.
- (E) Using a pre-trained network as a feature extractor typically requires less data than training a deep network from scratch.

## Today's lecture 

- What is time series? 
- How do we know a problem is a time series problem?
- Why do standard ML models struggle with time-dependent data?
- How can we adapt ML models to handle time series?

## Models for time series

The ML models we've used so far **do not have a built-in concept of time**. There are **two broad strategies** for modeling time series:

- Use models designed for sequential data which explicitly capture temporal dependencies (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Transformer architectures etc.) 

- **Use tabular ML models with engineered temporal features (e.g., Linear models, Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees)**    

## citibike data visualization

```{python}
print(f"Start date: {citibike.index.min()}, End date: {citibike.index.max()}")

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
xtick_labels = pd.date_range(start=citibike.index.min(), end=citibike.index.max(), freq="D")
plt.xticks(xtick_labels,  xtick_labels.strftime("%a %m-%d"), rotation=90, ha="left")
plt.plot(citibike, linewidth=1)
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Rentals");
plt.title("Number of bike rentals over time for a selected bike station");
```

Do you see any daily patterns? Weekly patterns? Noise? 

## ⛔️ Incorrect data splitting

```{python}
#| echo: true
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(citibike, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)
print('Train largest date: ', train_df.index.max())
print('Test smallest date: ', test_df.index.min())
```
```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 3))
train_df_sort = train_df.sort_index()
test_df_sort = test_df.sort_index()

plt.plot(train_df_sort, "b", label="train")
plt.plot(test_df_sort, "r", label="test")
plt.xticks(rotation="vertical")
plt.legend();
```

⛔️ We should never train on the future to predict the past!

## ✅ Correct data splitting

In time series, the simplest split is: earlier data $\rightarrow$ training and later data $\rightarrow$ testing. For example: 

```{python}
#| echo: true
n_train = 184 
train_df = citibike[:184] 
test_df = citibike[184:]
```
```{python}

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 3))
train_df_sort = train_df.sort_index()
test_df_sort = test_df.sort_index()

plt.plot(train_df_sort, "b", label="train")
plt.plot(test_df_sort, "r", label="test")
plt.xticks(rotation="vertical")
plt.legend();

# Feature engineering for time series 

## Motivation 

- In this toy data, we just have a single feature: the date time feature. 
- Note that ML models do not have a built-in concept of time. We have to give it to them.
- We will explore different ways to extract informative features from time.

## POSIX time feature {.smaller}
- Let's start with a simplest encoding. 
- A common way that dates are stored on computers is using POSIX time, which is the number of seconds since January 1970 00:00:00 (this is beginning of Unix time). 

- Let's start with encoding feature as a single integer representing this POSIX time. 

```{python}
#| echo: true
# convert to POSIX time by dividing by 10**9
X = (
    citibike.index.astype("int64").values.reshape(-1, 1) // 10**9
)  # convert to POSIX time by dividing by 10**9
y = citibike.values
X[:10]
```

## RF on posix features {.smaller}

```{python}
regressor = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
eval_on_features(X, y, regressor,  xtick_labels, feat_names="POSIX time")
```
- The predictions on the training data and training score are pretty good 
- But for the test data, a constant line is predicted ...
- What's going on?

## Trees cannot extrapolate! 
- Tree-based models only make predictions within the range of values they've seen during training.
- Trees partition the feature space into fixed regions and predictions inside each region are averages of training labels.
- If your future timestamps are larger than the ones in the training set trees cannot "see beyond" the training range and they will flatline or behave unpredictably.

This is exactly what happens with POSIX time encoded as a single numeric feature! 

## Extracting date and time information

- Note that our index is of this special type: [`DateTimeIndex`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DatetimeIndex.html). We can extract all kinds of interesting information from it.   

```{python}
#| echo: true
print(citibike.index[0])
print(citibike.index[0].month_name())
print(citibike.index[0].dayofweek)
print(citibike.index[0].hour)
```

## Hour of day 
- We noted before that the hour of day and day of week seem quite important. 
- Let's start with hour of day. 

```{python}
#| echo: true
X_hour = citibike.index.hour.values.reshape(-1, 1)
X_hour[:10]
```

## RF with hour of day

```{python}
#| echo: true
regressor = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
eval_on_features(X_hour, y, regressor,  xtick_labels, feat_names="Hour of the day")
```

The scores are better when we add hour of day feature! 

## hour of day + day of week 

Now let's add day of week along with hour of day. 
```{python}
#| echo: true
X_hour_week = np.hstack(
    [
        citibike.index.dayofweek.values.reshape(-1, 1),
        citibike.index.hour.values.reshape(-1, 1),
    ]
)
X_hour_week
```
## RF with hour of day + day of week 
```{python}
#| echo: true
eval_on_features(X_hour_week, y, regressor,  xtick_labels, feat_names = "hour of day + day of week")
```

The time of the day and day of the week features are clearly helping. 

## Ridge with Hour of day + Day of week 

```{python}
lr = Ridge();
eval_on_features(X_hour_week, y, lr,  xtick_labels, feat_names = "hour of day + day of week")

```

Why is `Ridge` performing poorly on the training data as well as test data?

## Encoding hour and day with OHE 

```{python}
#| echo: true
enc = OneHotEncoder()
X_hour_week_onehot = enc.fit_transform(X_hour_week).toarray()
hour = ["%02d:00" % i for i in range(0, 24, 3)]
day = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
features = day + hour
pd.DataFrame(X_hour_week_onehot, columns=features).head(6)
```

## Ridge with hour of day OHE + day of week OHE

:::: {.columns}

:::{.column width="70%"}
```{python}
eval_on_features(X_hour_week_onehot, y, Ridge(),  xtick_labels, feat_names="hour of day OHE + day of week OHE")
```
:::

:::{.column width="30%"}
- The scores are a bit better! 
- Can we improve them further? 
:::
::::

## Add interaction features 
```{python }
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

poly_transformer = PolynomialFeatures(
    interaction_only=True, include_bias=False
)
X_hour_week_onehot_poly = poly_transformer.fit_transform(X_hour_week_onehot)
hour = ["%02d:00" % i for i in range(0, 24, 3)]
day = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
features = day + hour
features_poly = poly_transformer.get_feature_names_out(features)
df_hour_week_ohe_poly = pd.DataFrame(X_hour_week_onehot_poly, columns = features_poly)
df_hour_week_ohe_poly.iloc[:, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 34, 35, 36, 37, 40]].head(6)
```

## Ridge with hour of day OHE + day of week OHE + interaction features

```{python}
eval_on_features(X_hour_week_onehot_poly, y, lr,  xtick_labels, feat_names = "hour of day OHE + day of week OHE + interaction feats")
```
The scores are much better now!! 

## Interpretation {.scrollable .smaller}

Since we are using a linear model, we can examine the coefficients learned by `Ridge`. 

:::: {.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

```{python}
features_nonzero = np.array(features_poly)[lr.coef_ != 0]
coef_nonzero = lr.coef_[lr.coef_ != 0]
pd.DataFrame(coef_nonzero, index=features_nonzero, columns=["Coefficient"]).sort_values(
    "Coefficient", ascending=False
)
```
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

**Do these coefficients make sense?**

:::
::::

## iClicker 19.2 

**Select all of the following statements which are TRUE.**

- (A) One-hot encoding the hour of day allows linear models to treat each hour as a separate category and capture cyclic patterns effectively.
- (B) Success in time-series modeling often depends more on choosing the right features and right encoding for the given model. 
- (C) Tree-based models are good at predicting values beyond the range of the training set because they can extrapolate trends.


## Lag-based features {.smaller .scrollable}

:::: {.columns}

:::{.column width="40%"}
```{python}
rentals_df = pd.DataFrame(citibike)
rentals_df = rentals_df.rename(columns={"one":"n_rentals"})
rentals_df.head(10)
```
:::

:::{.column width="60%"}
- In time series data there is temporal dependence; observations close in time tend to be correlated.
- Currently we're using current time to predict the number of bike rentals in the next three hours.
- But, what if the number of bike rentals is also related to bike rentals three hours ago or 6 hours ago and so on?
- Such features are called lagged features.
:::
:::: 



## Creating lag features {.smaller .scrollable}

```{python}
#| echo: true
def create_lag_df(df, lag, cols):
    return df.assign(
        **{f"{col}-{n}": df[col].shift(n) for n in range(1, lag + 1) for col in cols}
    )
rentals_lag5 = create_lag_df(rentals_df, 5, ['n_rentals'] )
rentals_lag5.head(8)
```

## Ridge with lag features

```{python}
X_lag_features = rentals_lag5.drop(columns = ['n_rentals']).to_numpy()
eval_on_features(X_lag_features, y, lr,  xtick_labels, feat_names="Lag features", impute="yes")
```

The model is performing poorly. 


## Random Forest with lag features

```{python}
imp = SimpleImputer()
X_lag_features_imp = imp.fit_transform(X_lag_features)
eval_on_features(X_lag_features_imp, y, regressor,  xtick_labels, feat_names="Lag features")
```

Better than the linear model but worse than our best model. 

## Ridge with all features
```{python}
X_hour_week_onehot_poly_lag = np.hstack([X_hour_week_onehot_poly, X_lag_features])
eval_on_features(X_hour_week_onehot_poly_lag, y, lr, xtick_labels, feat_names = "hour of day OHE + day of week OHE + interaction feats + Lag feats")
```

Good scores. But lag features don't seem to help much in this case. 


## RF with all features

```{python}
X_hour_week_lag = np.hstack([X_hour_week, X_lag_features])
eval_on_features(X_hour_week_lag, y, regressor,  xtick_labels, feat_names = "hour of day + day of week + Lag feats")
```

Lag features seem to make things a bit worse in this case.

## Cross-validation with time series

- We can't do regular cross-validation if we don't want to be predicting the past.

- There is [`TimeSeriesSplit`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html) for time series data. 

```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit
# Code from sklearn documentation
X_toy = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4]])
y_toy = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=3)
for train, test in tscv.split(X_toy):
    print("%s %s" % (train, test))
```

# Forecasting further into the future 

## Problem
- So far, our lag features let us predict 3 hours ahead. 
- What if we want to predict 15 hours in the future? 

- Problem: We do not yet know the rental counts for the required lag timestamps:
    - 2015-09-01 00:00:00
    - 2015-09-01 03:00:00
    - 2015-09-01 06:00:00
    - 2015-09-01 09:00:00
- Without those values, our lag features break 😢

## Approach 1: Iterative forecasting {.smaller}

Train one model that predicts 3 hours ahead. At prediction time, move forward step by step, using your own predictions as future lag inputs.

**Example:**

- Predict rentals at 00:00 on 2015-09-01.
- Use that prediction as the lag to predict rentals at 03:00.
- Use both predictions to predict rentals at 06:00.
- Continue until you reach 12:00.

This method works, but errors accumulate as we step forward. The longer the horizon, the more uncertainty grows. 

## Approach 2: Direct forecasting (multiple horizons)

- Train separate models for each horizon:
  - Model 1 $\rightarrow$ predict 3 hours ahead
  - Model 2 $\rightarrow$ predict 6 hours ahead
  - Model 3 $\rightarrow$ predict 9 hours ahead

Each model uses lag features that match the required horizon.


## (Optional) Approach 3: Multi-output models (joint forecasting)

- Train one model that predicts several future steps at once, e.g.:

  ```y = [rentals_in_3h, rentals_in_6h, rentals_in_9h, ...]```

- These models learn relationships across future time steps.
- Note: Multi-output forecasting is powerful, but outside the scope of CPSC 330.

# Seasonality and trends 

**Time series often show recognizable patterns over time**, which we want our models to capture.

## Seasonality

**Seasonality** refers to a **repeating pattern** that occurs at regular, predictable intervals.

- **Example 1:** Bike rentals tend to peak at the same hours each day (daily seasonality).  
- **Example 2:** Retail sales consistently spike before the December holidays (annual seasonality).
- Recognizing seasonality helps a model **anticipate recurring patterns** rather than mistake them for noise.
- We can capture seasonality by adding features such as: `rush_hour`, `is_weekend`, and `is_holiday`


## Trends {.smaller}

Let's consider another time series dataset, [Retail Sales of Clothing and Clothing Accessory Stores dataset](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MRTSSM448USN). 

```{python}
retail_df = pd.read_csv("data/MRTSSM448USN.csv", parse_dates=["DATE"])
retail_df.columns = ["date", "sales"]
retail_df.plot(x="date", y="sales", figsize=(8, 4));
```
- It looks like there's a clear trend; retail sales gradually increase over time.
- A **trend** is a long-term upward or downward movement in a time series.

Question: How might we encode this trend information so our models can use it?

## Days since feature {.scrollable .smaller}

One idea is to create a feature such as "Days_since"

```{python}
def lag_df(df, lag, cols):
    return df.assign(
        **{f"{col}-{n}": df[col].shift(n) for n in range(1, lag + 1) for col in cols}
    )
retail_lag_5 = lag_df(retail_df, 5, ["sales"])
retail_train_5 = retail_lag_5.query("date <= 20160101")
retail_test_5 = retail_lag_5.query("date >  20160101")
retail_train_5_date = retail_lag_5.query("date <= 20160101")
first_day_retail = retail_train_5_date["date"].min()

retail_train_5_date = retail_train_5_date.assign(
    Days_since=retail_train_5_date["date"].apply(lambda x: (x - first_day_retail).days)
)
retail_train_5_date.head(10)
```
