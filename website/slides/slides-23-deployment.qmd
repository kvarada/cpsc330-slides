## Announcements

- Last lecture today 🥺! 
- HW9 is due Friday, Dec 5th at 11:59 PM (No late submission allowed.)
- My OH next week has been moved to 11 AM. Do you prefer in-person or Zoom OH? 
- For an in-person OH I'll book a larger room. 

## ❓❓ Questions for you {.smaller}

Imagine you've created a machine learning model and are eager to share it with others. Consider the following scenarios for sharing your model:

- **To a non-technical Audience:** How would you present your model to friends and family who may not have a technical background?
- **To a technical audience:** How would you share your model with peers or professionals in the field who have a technical understanding of machine learning? 
- **In an academic or research setting:** How would you disseminate your model within academic or research communities?

## Try out this moment predictor

[https://cpsc330-moment-predictor.onrender.com/](https://cpsc330-moment-predictor.onrender.com/)

- In this lecture, I will show you how to set up/develop this. 

## What is deployment? 

- After we train a model, we want to use it!
- The user likely does not want to install your Python stack, train your model.
- You don't necessarily want to share the dataset.
- So we need to do two things:
  1. Save/store your model for later use.
  2. Make the saved model conveniently accessible.

## We will use the tools below 

For Saving the model

- We will use [Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/) 

For making the saved model conveniently accessible

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [render](https://render.com/)

## Course evaluations (~15 mins)

https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/170662/external_tools/53187

- They help us improve our teaching!
- UBC & CS uses them to provide rewards to instructors and TAs who are doing well!
- UBC & CS uses them to identify where instructors, TAs and courses need additional supports to improve.
- UBC uses these in evaluating professors for tenure and promotion.
- I'll very much appreciate your constructive and concrete feedback.  

## What did we cover 

- Part 1: Supervised learning on tabular data: ML fundamentals, preprocessing and data encoding, a bunch of models, evaluation metrics, feature importances and model transparency, feature selection, hyperparameter optimization
 
- Part 2: Dealing with other non-tabular data types: Clustering, recommender systems, computer vision with pre-trained deep learning models (high level), language data, text preprocessing, embeddings, topic modeling, time series, right-censored data / survival analysis

- Part 3: Communication, ethics, and deployment

## What we didn't cover 
- How do these models work under the hood

## What next?

If you want to further develop your machine learning skills:

- Practice!
- Work on your own projects. Make your work available and reproducible. 

- If you are interested in research in machine learning
  - Take CPSC 340. If you do not have the required prereqs you can try to audit it.
  - Get into the habit of reading papers and replicating results


## ❓❓ Questions for you

For each of the scenarios below 

- Identify if ML is a good solution for a problem. If yes
    - Frame the problem to a ML problem.
    - Discuss what kind of features you would need to effectively solve the problem
    - What would be a reasonable baseline? 
    - Which model would be a suitable model for the given scenario? 
    - What would be the appropriate success metrics.

## QueuePredictor app with call-level data {.smaller .scrollable}

:::{.column width="50%"}
```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('data/call-wait-time-v1.csv')
df
```
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
**Scenario:** A call center wants to inform callers of their expected wait time when they join the queue.

**Available data:** Historical calls with both completed (answered) and abandoned (hung up) calls.

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('data/call-wait-time-v2.csv')

**Scenario:** Same problem, but data is aggregated by 5-minute intervals instead of individual calls.

**Available data:** Each row represents a time window with summary statistics.

## Conclusion & farewell {.smaller}

That's all! We made it! I hope you learned something useful from the course. You all are wonderful students and I had fun teaching this course ♥️!

If you didn’t fill out course evaluations during class , it’ll be great if you can fill them in when you get a chance.

## Time permitting
