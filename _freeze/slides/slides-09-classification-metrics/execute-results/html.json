Due next week Monday. \n- HW5 will be released next week Tuesday. It's a project-type assignment and you get till Oct 28th to work on it.  \n\n\n\n## ML workflow \n![](img/ml-workflow.png)\n\n## Confusion matrix questions \n\nImagine a spam filter model where emails classified as spam are labeled 1 and non-spam emails are labeled 0. If a spam email is incorrectly classified as non-spam, what is this error called?\n\n- (A) A false positive\n- (B) A true positive\n- (C) A false negative\n- (D) A true negative\n\n## Confusion matrix questions\n\nIn an intrusion detection system, intrusions are identified as 1 and non-intrusive activities as 0. If the system fails to identify an actual intrusion, wrongly categorizing it as non-intrusive, what is this type of error called?\n\n- (A) A false positive\n- (B) A true positive\n- (C) A false negative\n- (D) A true negative\n\n## Confusion matrix questions\n\nIn a medical test for a disease, diseased states are labeled as 1 and healthy states as 0. If a healthy patient is incorrectly diagnosed with the disease, what is this error known as?\n\n- (A) A false positive\n- (B) A true positive\n- (C) A false negative\n- (D) A true negative\n\n\n## iClicker Exercise 9.1\n\n**iClicker cloud join link: https://join.iclicker.com/VYFJ**\n\n**Select all of the following statements which are TRUE.**\n\n- (A) In medical diagnosis, false positives are more damaging than false negatives (assume \"positive\" means the person has a disease, \"negative\" means they don't).\n- (B) In spam classification, false positives are more damaging than false negatives (assume \"positive\" means the email is spam, \"negative\" means they it's not).\n- (C) If method A gets a higher accuracy than method B, that means its precision is also higher.\n- (D) If method A gets a higher accuracy than method B, that means its recall is also higher.\n\n## Counter examples\n\nMethod A - higher accuracy but lower precision\n\n| Negative | Positive\n| -------- |:-------------:|\n| 90      | 5|\n| 5      | 0|\n\nMethod B - lower accuracy but higher precision\n\n| Negative | Positive\n| -------- |:-------------:|\n| 80      | 15|\n| 0      | 5|\n\n\n## Thresholding Exercise 9.2\n\n**iClicker cloud join link: https://join.iclicker.com/VYFJ**\n\n**Select all of the following statements which are TRUE.**\n\n- (A) If we increase the classification threshold, both true and false positives are likely to decrease.\n- (B) If we increase the classification threshold, both true and false negatives are likely to decrease.\n- (C) Lowering the classification threshold generally increases the modelâ€™s recall.  \n- (D) Raising the classification threshold can improve the precision of the model if it effectively reduces the number of false positives without significantly affecting true positives.\n\n\n## ROC AUC questions\n\nConsider the points A, B, and C in the following diagram, each representing a threshold. Which threshold would you pick in each scenario?\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](img/auc_abc)\n:::\n\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n- (A) If false positives (false alarms) are highly costly\n- (B) If false positives are cheap and false negatives (missed true positives) highly costly\n- (C) If the costs are roughly equivalent\n:::\n::::\n\n[Source](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc)\n\n",
