You've got this! 😊\n- Next lecture on Ethics will be delivered by Giulia (Section 101 and 103 instructor)\n\n## iClicker (Survival analysis recap) {.smaller}\n\n**Select all of the following statements which are TRUE.**\n\n- (A) Right censoring occurs when the endpoint of event has not been observed for all study subjects by the end of the study period.\n- (B) Right censoring implies that the data is missing completely at random.\n- (C) In the presence of right-censored data, binary classification models can be applied directly without any modifications or special considerations.\n- (D) If we apply the `Ridge` regression model to predict tenure in right censored data, we are likely to underestimate it because the tenure observed in our data is shorter than what it would be in reality.\n\n## Recap {.smaller}\n\n- What is right-censored data?\n- What happens when we treat right-censored data the same as \"regular\" data?\n    - Predicting churn vs. no churn\n    - Predicting tenure\n        - Throw away people who haven't churned\n        - Assume everyone churns today\n- Survival analysis encompasses predicting both churn and tenure and deals with censoring and can make rich and interesting predictions!\n    - We can get survival curves which show the probability of survival over time.\n    - KM model $\\rightarrow$ doesn't look at features\n    - CPH model $\\rightarrow$ like linear regression, does look at the features and provides coefficients associated with each feature\n    \n\n## Why communication?\n\nWhy spend a whole lecture on this?\n\n- **Great technical work often dies silently due to poor communication. **\n- Most ML work happens in teams with diverse backgrounds.\n- Decisions, budgets, and user trust depend on how you present results.\n- Effective communication $\\rightarrow$ adoption and impact \n\n## Is this misleading? {.smaller}\n\n![](img/ml-communication.png){.nostretch fig-align=\"center\" width=\"800px\"}\n\nWhat additional information would you need to evaluate the validity of this claim?\n\n\n## Main issues in ML-related communication {.smaller}\n\n- Overclaiming and unclear limitations\n- No baseline or missing context for metrics\n- Metric dumping without a narrative or decision link\n- Jargon/abstraction mismatch to the audience\n- Unexplained predictions\n- Hidden assumptions or data leakage\n- Probability misinterpretation (e.g., `predict_proba=0.9` $\\neq$ 90% certain)\n- Unreliable test error due to weak validation\n\n\n## What happens if... {.smaller}\n\n**Pick one scenario. Discuss 2 negative consequences and 1 thing you'd do to prevent them.** \n\n1. You build an amazing model but fail to clearly communicate its value or results to your manager.\n2. You present a 98% accuracy without mentioning the trivial baseline is 97.5%.\n3. You say: \"SHAP values show nonlinear feature interactions\" to a non-technical stakeholder and stop there.\n4. A user asks why they were denied a loan; you give no explanation of the model's decision.\n5. You hide uncertainty and overpromise deployment success.\n\n\n# Principles of good communicaiton\n\n\n## Grid search activity {.smaller}\n\nGo to this Google doc: https://tinyurl.com/5n8xf5yj\n\n:::: {.columns}\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\nExplanation 1: https://tinyurl.com/msk2cfkb\n\n![](img/gs-explanation1.png)\n\n:::\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n\nExplanation 2: https://tinyurl.com/mt2z9ey5\n\n![](img/gs-explanation2.png)\n\n:::\n::::\n\n## Discussion questions {.smaller}\n\n- What do you like about each explanation?\n- What do you dislike about each explanation?\n- What do you think is the intended audience for each explanation?\n- Which explanation do you think is more effective overall for someone on Day 1 of CPSC 330?\n- Each explanation has an image. Which one is more effective? What are the pros/cons?\n- Each explanation has some sample code. Which one is more effective? What are the pros/cons?\n\n\n## _Concepts then labels, not the other way around_\n:::: {.columns}\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Explanation 1:** Machine learning algorithms, like an airplane’s cockpit, typically involve a bunch of knobs and switches that need to be set.\n:::\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n**Explanation 2:** Grid search is the process of performing hyper parameter tuning in order to determine the optimal values for a given model.\n:::\n::::\n\nThe effectiveness of these different statements depend on your audience.\n\n## _Concepts then labels, not the other way around_\n\n::: {#fc39de68 .cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n```{=html}\n\n        <iframe\n            width=\"500\"\n            height=\"450\"\n            src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/px_4TxC2mXU\"\n            frameborder=\"0\"\n            allowfullscreen\n            \n        ></iframe>\n        \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n[Feynman video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px_4TxC2mXU)\n\n## _Top down vs. bottom up_\n:::: {.columns}\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n- Start with the big picture\n- Then gradually reveal the structure and key components\n\n![](img/top_down.png)\n\n:::\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n- Start with the details \n- Build to the big picture\n\n![](img/bottom_up.png)\n:::\n::::\n\nIn the previous explanations, which one represented a bottom-up explanation and which one a top-down explanation? \n\n## _New ideas in small chunks_\n\nThe hidden structure in the first explanation\n\n1. The concept of setting a bunch of values.\n2. Random forest example.\n3. The problem / pain point.\n4. The solution.\n5. How it works - high level.\n6. How it works - written example.\n7. How it works - code example.\n8. The name of what we were discussing all this time.\n\n## _Reuse running examples_ \n\nEffective explanations often use the same example throughout the text and code. This helps readers follow the line of reasoning.\n\n## _Approach from all angles_\n- When we're trying to draw mental boundaries around a concept, it's helpful to see examples on all sides of those boundaries\n- It would have been nice to include \n  - Performance with and without hyperparameter tuning. \n  - Other types of hyperparameter tuning (e.g. `RandomizedSearchCV`).\n\n## _When experimenting, show the results asap_\n\nThe first explanation shows the output of the code, whereas the second does not. This is easy to do and makes a big difference.\n\n## _It's not about you_\n\n- Interesting to you != useful to the reader\n- Examine the hidden intention of wanting to include something that's not important \n  - Am I trying to sound smart or prove I know something?\n  - Am I afraid that leaving it out makes the work look too simple?\n  - Am I adding it because I spent time on it and want that effort to be visible?\n\n> **If it doesn't serve the audience, it's noise.**\n\n## Core questions you must be ready to answer\n\n- What does this result mean (in plain language)?\n- When does the model work? When does it fail? (failure modes)\n- Why did it make this prediction? (explainability path)\n- What are the risks & consequences of using it?\n- How does it compare to doing nothing or current practice?\n- What is the cost to maintain / retrain / monitor?\n\n## Quick checklist (use before presenting)\n\n1. [ ] Who is my audience and what do they care about?\n2. [ ] What decision do I want them to make?\n3. [ ] What baseline(s) am I comparing against?\n4. [ ] What caveats or limitations must I disclose?\n5. [ ] What is the recommended next action?\n6. [ ] How will we monitor after deployment?\n\n\n# ML and decision making \n\n## ❓❓ Questions for you\n\nImagine you are tasked with developing a recommender system for YouTube. You possess data on which users clicked on which videos. After spending considerable time building a recommender system using this data, you realize it isn't producing high-quality recommendations. What could be the reasons for this?\n\n## \n\nImagine you are tasked with developing a recommender system for YouTube. You possess data on which users clicked on which videos. After spending considerable time building a recommender system using this data, you realize it isn't producing high-quality recommendations. What could be the reasons for this?\n\n- Clicks $\\neq$ True preferences\n- No information about watch time\n- Clicks can be gamed\n\n## Think beyond what's given to you\n\nQuestions you have to consider:\n\n- Who is the decision maker?\n- What are their objectives?\n- What are their alternatives?\n- What is their context?\n- What data do I need?\n\n## Decisions involve a few key pieces\n\n- The **decision variable**: the variable that is manipulated through the decision.\n  - E.g. how much should I sell my house for? (numeric)\n- The decision-maker's **objectives**: the variables that the decision-maker ultimately cares about\n  - E.g. my total profit, time to sale, etc.\n- The **context**: the variables that mediate the relationship between the decision variable and the objectives.\n  - E.g. the housing market, cost of marketing it, my timeline, etc.\n\n## Poor vs. Effective communication {.smaller}\n\nImagine that you're explaining your work to your manager who is not very technical. Which one is pooer and which one is more effective? Why? \n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n**Communication 1**\n\n\"I built models to predict next week's avocado prices.

Vancouver has the highest cost of living of all cities in Canada. **I am 95% sure of this.** \n2. Vancouver has the highest cost of living of all cities in Canada. **I am 55% sure of this.** \n\nThe part is bold is called a [credence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credence_(statistics)). Which belief is better?\n\n## \n\nBut what if it's actually Toronto that has the highest cost of living in Canada?\n\n1. Vancouver has the highest cost of living of all cities in Canada. **I am 95% sure of this.** \n2. Vancouver has the highest cost of living of all cities in Canada. **I am 55% sure of this.** \n\nWhich belief is better now?\n\n**We don't just want to be right. We want to be confident when we're right and hesitant when we're wrong.**\n\n## Loss in machine learning \n\nWhen you call `fit` for `LogisticRegression` it has similar preferences: \n<br>\n<span style=\"color:green\">**correct and confident**</span> <br> **>** <span style=\"color:cyan\"> **correct and hesitant** </span>  <br> **>** <span style=\"color:orange\">**incorrect and hesitant**</span> <br> **>**  <span style=\"color:red\">**incorrect and confident**</span> \n   \n- This is a \"loss\" or \"error\" function like mean squared error, so lower values are better.\n- When you call `fit` it tries to minimize this metric.\n\n## What should be the loss? {.smaller .scrollable}\n\nConsider the following made-up classification example where target (true `y`) is binary: -1 or 1. The true $y$ (`y_true`) and models raw scores ($w^Tx_i$) are given to you. You want to figure out how do you want to punish the mistakes made by the current model. How will you punish the model in each case?  \n\n::: {#191bcf67 .cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>y_true</th>\n      <th>raw score ($w^Tx_i$)</th>\n      <th>correct?

This would involve rating how sure you are about each answer, perhaps on a percentage scale from 0% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely sure). This method not only assesses your knowledge but also your awareness of your own understanding, potentially impacting the grading process and highlighting areas for improvement.
