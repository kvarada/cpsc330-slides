{.smaller}\n\n- Success in time-series analysis heavily relies on the appropriate choice of models and features.\n- Tree-based models cannot extrapolate; caution is needed when using them with linear integer features.\n- Linear models struggle with cyclic patterns in numeric features (e.g., numerically encoded time of the day feature) because these patterns are inherently non-linear.\n- Applying one-hot encoding on such features transforms cyclic temporal features into a format where their impact on the target variable can be independently and linearly modeled, enabling linear models to effectively capture and use these cyclic patterns. \n\n## Lag-based features\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n:::{.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n::: {#49be1ccd .cell execution_count=23}\n\n::: {.cell-output

In other words, what if we want to predict number of rentals for the next three hours at time 2015-09-01 12:00:00?  \n- Problem: We do not yet know the rental counts for the required lag timestamps:\n    - 2015-09-01 00:00:00\n    - 2015-09-01 03:00:00\n    - 2015-09-01 06:00:00\n    - 2015-09-01 09:00:00\n- Without those values, our lag features break 😢\n\n## Approach 1: Iterative forecasting\n\n- Train one model that predicts 3 hours ahead.\n- At prediction time, move forward step by step, using your own predictions as future lag inputs.\n\n**Example:**\n\n- Predict rentals at 00:00 on 2015-09-01.\n- Use that prediction as the lag to predict rentals at 03:00.\n- Use both predictions to predict rentals at 06:00.\n- Continue until you reach 12:00.\n\nThis method works, but errors accumulate as we step forward. The longer the horizon, the more uncertainty grows. \n\n## Approach 2: Direct forecasting (multiple horizons)\n\n- Train separate models for each horizon:\n  - Model 1 $\\rightarrow$ predict 3 hours ahead\n  - Model 2 $\\rightarrow$ predict 6 hours ahead\n  - Model 3 $\\rightarrow$ predict 9 hours ahead\n\nEach model uses lag features that match the required horizon.\n\n\n## (Optional) Approach 3: Multi-output models (joint forecasting)\n\n- Train one model that predicts several future steps at once, e.g.:\n\n  ```y = [rentals_in_3h, rentals_in_6h, rentals_in_9h, ...]```\n\n- These models learn relationships across future time steps.\n- Note: Multi-output forecasting is powerful, but outside the scope of CPSC 330.\n\n# Seasonality and trends \n\n\n## Trends \nLet's consider another time series dataset, [Retail Sales of Clothing and Clothing Accessory Stores dataset](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MRTSSM448USN). \n\n::: {#b7b2d375 .cell execution_count=30}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](slides-19-time-series_files/figure-revealjs/cell-31-output-1.png){width=823 height=434}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- It looks like there's a **trend** here; the sales are going up over time. \n- How can we encode this information in the model?\n\n\n## \n\n- One idea is to create a feature such as \"Days_since\"\n\n::: {#9dbaf152 .cell execution_count=31}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=31}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>date</th>\n      <th>sales</th>\n      <th>sales-1</th>\n      <th>sales-2</th>\n      <th>sales-3</th>\n      <th>sales-4</th>\n      <th>sales-5</th>\n      <th>Days_since</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>1992-01-01</td>\n      <td>6938</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>1992-02-01</td>\n      <td>7524</td>\n      <td>6938.0</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>31</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>1992-03-01</td>\n      <td>8475</td>\n      <td>7524.0</td>\n      <td>6938.0</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>60</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>1992-04-01</td>\n      <td>9401</td>\n      <td>8475.0</td>\n      <td>7524.0</td>\n      <td>6938.0</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>91</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>1992-05-01</td>\n      <td>9558</td>\n      <td>9401.0</td>\n      <td>8475.0</td>\n      <td>7524.0</td>\n      <td>6938.0</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>121</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>5</th>\n      <td>1992-06-01</td>\n      <td>9182</td>\n      <td>9558.0</td>\n      <td>9401.0</td>\n      <td>8475.0</td>\n      <td>7524.0</td>\n      <td>6938.0</td>\n      <td>152</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>6</th>\n      <td>1992-07-01</td>\n      <td>9103</td>\n      <td>9182.0</td>\n      <td>9558.0</td>\n      <td>9401.0</td>\n      <td>8475.0</td>\n      <td>7524.0</td>\n      <td>182</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>7</th>\n      <td>1992-08-01</td>\n      <td>10513</td>\n      <td>9103.0</td>\n      <td>9182.0</td>\n      <td>9558.0</td>\n      <td>9401.0</td>\n      <td>8475.0</td>\n      <td>213</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>8</th>\n      <td>1992-09-01</td>\n      <td>9573</td>\n      <td>10513.0</td>\n      <td>9103.0</td>\n      <td>9182.0</td>\n      <td>9558.0</td>\n      <td>9401.0</td>\n      <td>244</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>9</th>\n      <td>1992-10-01</td>\n      <td>10254</td>\n      <td>9573.0</td>\n      <td>10513.0</td>\n      <td>9103.0</td>\n      <td>9182.0</td>\n      <td>9558.0</td>\n      <td>274</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# [Class demo](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330-2024W1/blob/main/lectures/102-Varada-lectures/class_demos/demo_20_time-series.ipynb) \n\n",
