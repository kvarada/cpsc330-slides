Good for structured decision making. \n- Human experts are good with problems which require deep contextual understanding, ethical judgment, creative input, or emotional intelligence.\n\n## Recap: Supervised learning\n\n- We wish to find a model function $f$ that relates $X$ to $y$.\n- We use the model function to predict targets of new examples. \n\n![](img/sup-learning.png){.nostretch fig-align=\"center\" width=\"700px\"}\n\nIn the first part of this course, we'll focus on supervised machine learning. \n\n## iClicker 2.2: Supervised vs unsupervised {.smaller}\n\nClicker cloud join link: \n\nSelect all of the following statements which are examples of supervised machine learning\n\n- (A) Finding groups of similar properties in a real estate data set.\n- (B) Predicting whether someone will have a heart attack or not on the basis of demographic, diet, and clinical measurement.\n- (C) Grouping articles on different topics from different news sources (something like the Google News app).\n- (D) Detecting credit card fraud based on examples of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.\n- (E) Given some measure of employee performance, identify the key factors which are likely to influence their performance.\n\n\n## iClicker 2.3: Classification vs. Regression {.smaller}\n\nClicker cloud join link: \n \nSelect all of the following statements which are examples of regression problems\n\n- (A) Predicting the price of a house based on features such as number of bedrooms and the year built.\n- (B) Predicting if a house will sell or not based on features like the price of the house, number of rooms, etc.\n- (C) Predicting percentage grade in CPSC 330 based on past grades.\n- (D) Predicting whether you should bicycle tomorrow or not based on the weather forecast.\n- (E) Predicting appropriate thermostat temperature based on the wind speed and the number of people in a room.\n\n\n## Today's focus \n\n- ML Terminology\n- Using sklearn to build a simple supervised ML model\n- Intuition of Decision Trees\n\n## Framework\n\n- There are many frameworks to do do machine learning. \n- We'll mainly be using [`scikit-learn` framework](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). \n\n::: {#c0c79a7e .cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n```{=html}\n\n        <iframe\n            width=\"1000\"\n            height=\"650\"\n            src=\"https://scikit-learn.org\"\n            frameborder=\"0\"\n            allowfullscreen\n            \n        ></iframe>\n        \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Running example {.smaller}\n\nImagine you're in the fortunate situation where, after graduating, you have a few job offers and need to decide which one to choose.
